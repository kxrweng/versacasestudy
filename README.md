# Your Project Name

Welcome to Versa Case Study! This repository contains the case study that I am tasked to do. To run the included JavaScript file, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/directory
    ```
3. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```
4. Change into the cloned repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd repository
    ```

## Installing Code Runner Extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (click on the Extensions icon or use `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Code Runner" by Jun Han and click "Install" for the corresponding extension.

## Running the JavaScript File

1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the cloned repository.
2. Configure Code Runner preferences if needed (File -> Preferences -> Settings or `Ctrl+,`).
3. Open the bigbang.js in the editor.
4. Click the play-button at the nav bar located on the right.

Ensure that the JavaScript file is the active tab in the editor when running it with Code Runner.

The output, as mentioned in the case study, is written onto output.json. Alternatively, if for some reason it is not working as intended, you can look at the output at your console!
